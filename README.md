# BONGA-Image-Stitching

## Flow
To run the app, just clone the repository and run ```main.py``` file in the root of the project. It will generate 2 HTML files with areas which are covered in the [images](https://github.com/SevkavTV/BONGA-Image-Stitching/tree/main/images) and one JPG file which is a panorama from 4 images. All this resulted files you can find in ```output``` folder.
